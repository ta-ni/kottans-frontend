# Stage 0. Self-Study

## Task 0. Git Basics

I have experience with Git but the course "How to use Git and GitHub" from Udacity gave me some new information so it was useful for me. Thanks.
Also I want to share the game that can help to learn git commands:

## Task 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP

I got information about HTTP. And I repeated basic CLI commands.
